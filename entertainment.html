                    <p>Taking its name from the Arabic term tariba, meaning the ecstatic
                        feelings evoked by true musical artistry, taarab has its origins in
                        court music traditions of the Arab elite of late nineteenth-century
                        Zanzibar and coastal Kenya.Zanzibar played a significant role in the development and popularization of taraab music. The genre emerged in the late 19th century and was initially performed in private homes and social gatherings. Over time, taraab evolved into a more professional form of entertainment, with dedicated orchestras and ensembles performing in public venues like the famous Stone Town in Zanzibar. </p>
