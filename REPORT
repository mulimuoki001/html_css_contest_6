Usage and implementation of CSS 

In developing the website design, we used various CSS properties and selectors that we learned this term. Properties were used to style multiple elements within the webpage. Our CSS code utilized a combination of element selectors, class selectors, and I.D. selectors. The application of selectors includes:

1. The universal selector(*) was used to set the margin, padding, box-sizing, and font family properties for all elements to ensure a consistent base styling.

2. Class selectors. These were used to select elements based on elements' class attribute values. For example, the inner carousel simultaneously used the same style for different image elements. This is used by adding a .before the class. 

3. The id selectors. When we were targeting only one element, id selectors came in handy. #button was used to target button elements with the id button. 

4. The .container class targeted style containers.

CSS properties applied include:
1. Margin: Sets outer spacing of elements.
2. Padding: Sets the inner spacing of components.
3 Box-sizing: Specifies box model used for sizing and layout.
4. Font-family: Defines preferred font.
5. Width: Sets the width of an element.
6. Color: Sets the color of text and other elements.
7. Display: Defines how an element is displayed. Flex was used throughout for consistency.
8. Justify content: Aligns flex items along the cross-axis.
9. Background color: Sets the background color.
10. Border: Sets border properties.
11. Text transform Controls capitalization.
12. Font size: Sets the scope.
13. Border radius: used in images to specify roundness
14. Font-weight: Specifies the thickness of the font. 


Usage and implementation of HTML

After learning HTML this term, we used it to structure content on our ZanziBliss webpage. We utilized HTML elements and semantic tags and adhered to proper document structure.

For a proper document structure, our HTML codes follow a logical structure:
1. <!DOCTYPE html> This was placed at the beginning of all our HTML files to specify that the document type is HTML5.
<html lang=" en"> Indicates that the content is in English.
2.<head> Contains meta-information and external resources used by ZanziBliss.Under this:
       		<link> Imports CSS from the CSS file.
     	<meta>Sets character encoding, compatibility mode, and viewport settings for the webpage.
  	 <title> Specifies the title of webpage; ZanziBliss.
       </head> Marks the end of the head.
 4. <body> represents the main content of the webpage.
           	<header> Defines header section containing the logo and navigation menu.
                  <nav> navigation section.
                 <ul> Represents an unordered list of navigation links.
                 <li> Defines individual list items.
                 <a> Creates hyperlinks to our different sections of the webpage: Travel, Entertainment, About us, and Support section.

HTML Best Practices Used:

.Semantics tags such as <h1>, <p>, <ul>, <li>, <img>, <q>, <button> were used.

.We used sections to organize content into meaningful blocks for easier working.

.Our codes adhere to indentation and formatting conventions, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

.External CSS codes are linked to our HTML document. 

Making a responsive website
This was the most dificult task and we managed but for some specific sections of the website suc as the contact us page and the about us page.

In our codes,The provided CSS code on our github demonstrates a responsive design approach that adjusts the layout and appearance of elements based on the width of the viewport. By using media queries, these CSS rules enabled our website layout and elements to adapt to different screen sizes. The adjustments made to the positioning, size, and font ensure a better user experience and readability on devices with smaller screens.
