        <h2>About <span>Zanzibar</span> Island</h2>
      </div>
      <p>The Zanzibar Archipelago, located in the Indian Ocean 15 miles off the coast of Tanzania,
        is a breathtaking spot to escape from the world. You’ll enjoy clear, turquoise-blue water;
        shallow sandbars perfect for wading; and many small, nearly deserted islands virtually unvisited by tourists.
        Explore the World Heritage Site of Stone Town, Zanzibar City’s old quarter.
        Or just go beach to beach between tiny fishing villages—each one's better than the next.</p>
